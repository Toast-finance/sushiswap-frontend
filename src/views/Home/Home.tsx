        <StyledInfo>
            üí° Toast.finance started with the HOUSE and AVO tokens. We added EGGS, and finally, we're cooking up some TOAST.<br />This is a community project. HOUSE, AVO and EGGS all have fixed supplies and are totally and fairly distributed to the community.<br />
            TOAST is our inflationary rewards token, and is only earned by participating in pools here. Like all of our tokens, it has a <strong>0% dev share</strong>!<br />There were no ICOs, no presales, no airdrops, no early wallets, and no dev/team wallets or funds.
